## Introduction

This repository contains the Pytorch implementation of [Deep Sketch-Based Modeling: Tips and Tricks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06133), including binary mask prediction and 3D shape reconstruction. 

You can find detailed usage instructions for training and evaluation below.

 If you use our code or dataset, please cite our work:

## Requirements

First you have to make sure that you have all dependencies in place.
The simplest way to do so, is to use [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

Please refer the README file in each sub-task for detailed instruction.
## Download Dataset
We use two datasets in this paper: the [ProSketch dataset](http://personal.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/Y.Song/ProSketch-3Dchair.zip) and a dataset of [synthetic sketches](https://cvssp.org/data/SyntheticChairSketch/).

ProSketch is a dataset of human sketches, and is a part of [this publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9272370).
The synthetic data can be generated for other shapes and categories as described below.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Most of our experiments are conducted on the modelsfrom a chair category of the ShapeNetCore dataset2, complemented by two additional categories:  planes and lamps. We selected these categories guided by the next principles: 1) Easy to sketch. 2) Generality. 3) View differentiability. 4) Shape genius higher than 1。 5) Large inter-category variance. We generate three categories with distinctive styles, whichwe refer to as naive, stylized and style-unified. Please refer paper for further details.


## Generate your own dataset

To generated your own dataset, simply run the code below to generate the synthetic dataset.
=======
### Generate your own dataset of synthetic sketches.
>>>>>>> 7f62f677dfa092f05c22287d0ac9e18ef621caf3

```bash
python dataset/run.py
```

Note: you need to change the *.csv file according to your own dataset.

Then, to stylised the genertaed dataset, run the code from [SynDraw](https://gitlab.inria.fr/D3/contour-detect/-/blob/master/svg_tools/svg_disturber.py)

```bash
python dataset/svg_tools_svg_disturber.py -a -c -n 1.3 -r 2.5 -sl 0.9 -su 1.1 -t 2 -min 1 -max 2 -os 1 -pen 2.5 -penv 1.5 -bg -u
```

## Results

We identify key differences between sketch and image inputs, driving out important insights and proposing the respective solutions, we show an improved performance of deep image modeling.
