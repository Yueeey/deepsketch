# Deep Sketch-Based Modeling: Tips and Tricks 

This repository contains the code for 3D shape reconstruction, this code is based on [Occupancy Networks - Learning 3D Reconstruction in Function Space](https://avg.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/publications/occupancy-networks).

You can find detailed usage instructions for training and evaluation below.

## Installation
First you have to make sure that you have all dependencies in place.
The simplest way to do so, is to use [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). 

You can create an anaconda environment called `mesh_funcspace` using
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate mesh_funcspace
```

Next, compile the extension modules.
You can do this via
```
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

To compile the dmc extension, you have to have a cuda enabled device set up.
If you experience any errors, you can simply comment out the `dmc_*` dependencies in `setup.py`.
You should then also comment out the `dmc` imports in `im2mesh/config.py`.

## Usage
When you have installed all binary dependencies and obtained the preprocessed data, you are ready to run our code.

### Training
To train a model, run
```
python train.py CONFIG.yaml
```
where you replace `CONFIG.yaml` with the name of the configuration file you want to use. Change the datapath in `CONFIG.yaml` to your dataset for training.

You can monitor on <http://localhost:6006> the training process using [tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/summaries_and_tensorboard):
```
cd OUTPUT_DIR
tensorboard --logdir ./logs --port 6006
```
where you replace `OUTPUT_DIR` with the respective output directory.

For available training options, please take a look at `configs/default.yaml`.

### Generation
To generate meshes using a trained model, use
```
python generate.py CONFIG.yaml
```
where you replace `CONFIG.yaml` with the correct config file.
